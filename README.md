Greetings, here you will see some possibilities of this discord bot, as well as potential future implementations. If you are interested on how everything works there is a dedicated section in the end.


First of all, the most basic usage of the bot is to roll different dice rolls.
The syntax is "!roll <number of dice>d<type of dice>". Example: "!roll 3d20", "!roll 2d54".
Upon calling the command a list of the die results will be shown. If a die hits the maximum value, "Critical!" will be shown, and if the die hits 1, "Critical Failure!" will appear.

## Discontinued
  
  Unfortunately, due to a recent announcement that the Discord.py library will cease to be supported, the project is discontinued and development will move to a web-app based similar solution.
