Bugfixing/Optimisation:
-Verify values for all user input values (class,race,weapon,items, numerical values etc.)
-Do thorough tests and fix errors/bugs
-Optimize current code and refactor code in big functions (notably character creation)
-Set up non-relational database for spells and characters, and benchmark to see if it works faster than current raw filename search.
Character Classes:
-Create them
-Create all their character features and apply their effects
-Implement level up
-Implement short/long rests
Items and Consumables:
-Create python class similar to Weapons and Armors to regroup and verify them
-Add features such as weapon/armor equip, attacking with weapon, manage items easily
-Add coin types and conversion functions
Interface:
-Convert all messages sent by the bot to embeds and make them better
-Expand the "cancel command" system in place for long commands such as character creation
